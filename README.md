# San Francisco Bike SQL & Dashboard 

ðŸ’¬ This is a task I completed using the San Francisco Bike dataset in Big Query to build a dashboard to show interesting trends in the data. This was an interesting task because there is both geo and temporal data in the dataset and using Power BI is a perfect way to show trends in the data in an accessible way

## ðŸ’¾ Files in this repo are:
- Build a Search Engine - TO ADD

## âš¡ TO DO:
- Power BI doesn't make it easy to share dashboards without a subscription so I shall remake this dashboard in Data Studio and share it with this repo
